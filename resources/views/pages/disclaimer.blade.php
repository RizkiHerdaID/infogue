                    <h3>Company-owned information held on third-party websites</h3>

                    <p>If you produce, collect and/or process business-related information in the course of your work, the
                        information remains the property of InfoGue.id. This includes such information stored on
                        third-party websites such as webmail service providers and social networking sites, such as Facebook
                        and LinkedIn.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Monitoring</h3>

                    <p>InfoGue.id accepts that the use of the internet is a valuable business tool. However, misuse of
                        this facility can have a negative impact upon employee productivity and the reputation of the
                        business.
                    </p>

                    <p>In addition, all of the company's internet-related resources are provided for business purposes.
                        Therefore, the company maintains the right to monitor the volume of internet and network traffic,
                        together with the internet sites visited. The specific content of any transactions will not be
                        monitored unless there is a suspicion of improper use.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sanctions</h3>

                    <p>Where it is believed that an employee has failed to comply with this policy, they will face the
                        company's disciplinary procedure. If the employee is found to have breached the policy, they will
                        face a disciplinary penalty ranging from a verbal warning to dismissal. The actual penalty applied
                        will depend on factors such as the seriousness of the breach and the employee's disciplinary record.
                        [These procedures will be specific to your business. They should reflect your normal operational and
                        disciplinary processes. You should establish them from the outset and include them in your
                        acceptable use policy.]
                    </p>

                    <h3>Agreement</h3>

                    <p>All company employees, contractors or temporary staff who have been granted the right to use the
                        company's internet access are required to sign this agreement confirming their understanding and
                        acceptance of this policy.
